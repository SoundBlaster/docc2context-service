# Task PRD: 2.1 — Frontend Project Setup

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Source:** Workplan.md Task 2.1  
**Priority:** High  
**Phase:** 2  
**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Dependencies:** Task 1.3  

## Objective

Set up frontend structure with static directory, choose styling approach (Tailwind CSS via CDN or simple CSS file), and create base HTML structure with proper meta tags and responsive layout.

## Current State Analysis

Based on repository inspection:
- FastAPI backend is complete from Phase 1
- CORS is configured in Task 1.3
- No frontend files exist yet
- Need to create static directory and HTML structure
- Need to choose between Tailwind CSS vs simple CSS approach

## Implementation Plan

### Subtask 2.1.1: Create Frontend Structure
**Files to touch:**
- `app/static/` directory (create if not exists)
- `app/static/index.html` (main HTML file)
- `app/static/css/` directory (for styling)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Static directory is created in FastAPI app
- [ ] HTML file is accessible via web server
- [ ] Directory structure follows web best practices
- [ ] Static files are properly served by FastAPI

### Subtask 2.1.2: Choose and Implement Styling Approach
**Files to touch:**
- `app/static/css/style.css` (if using simple CSS)
- OR integrate Tailwind CSS via CDN in HTML

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Styling framework is chosen and implemented
- [ ] CSS is properly linked in HTML
- [ ] Styling is responsive and modern
- [ ] Approach is consistent with project requirements

### Subtask 2.1.3: Create Base HTML Structure
**Files to touch:**
- `app/static/index.html` (main HTML file)
- `app/static/js/` directory (for future JavaScript)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] HTML5 semantic structure is used
- [ ] Proper meta tags are included
- [ ] Responsive viewport meta tag
- [ ] Basic layout structure is responsive
- [ ] File upload interface is prepared

### Subtask 2.1.4: Integrate with FastAPI Static Serving
**Files to touch:**
- `app/main.py` (ensure static files are served)
- Test static file serving

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Static files are served correctly
- [ ] HTML is accessible at root URL
- [ ] CSS and other assets load properly
- [ ] No 404 errors for static assets

## Definition of Done

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Frontend files are accessible
- [ ] Styling framework is integrated
- [ ] Base HTML structure is responsive
- [ ] Static serving works with FastAPI

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] HTML5 semantic markup is used
- [ ] CSS follows modern best practices
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/desktop
- [ ] Performance is optimized for static assets

### Frontend Architecture
```
app/static/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── css/
│   └── style.css      # Styling (or use Tailwind CDN)
└── js/                # Future JavaScript files
```

### HTML Structure
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>DocC2Context Service</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Convert Swift DocC archives to Markdown">
    <!-- Styling -->
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <h1>DocC2Context Service</h1>
        <p>Convert Swift DocC archives to Markdown</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <!-- File upload interface -->
    </main>
    <footer>
        <p>&copy; 2026 DocC2Context Service</p>
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

### Styling Options

**Option A: Tailwind CSS via CDN**
- Pros: Modern utility-first CSS, responsive design built-in
- Cons: External dependency, larger bundle size
- Implementation: Add CDN link in HTML head

**Option B: Simple CSS File**
- Pros: No external dependencies, faster loading, full control
- Cons: More manual work for responsive design
- Implementation: Create custom CSS file

### Integration Points
- **Task 1.3**: FastAPI static file serving
- **Task 2.2**: Drag-and-drop upload zone
- **Task 2.3**: File upload interface integration

## Security Considerations

- **Content Security Policy**: Proper headers for static assets
- **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize any dynamic content
- **File Upload Security**: Frontend validation before backend
- **HTTPS**: Ensure all assets are served securely

## Risk Mitigation

- **Browser Compatibility**: Test on modern browsers
- **Performance**: Optimize static asset loading
- **Accessibility**: Use semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test on various screen sizes
