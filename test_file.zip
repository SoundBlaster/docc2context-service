The drag-and-drop upload zone has been successfully implemented and tested. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Drag-and-Drop Zone HTML
- Created a visual drop zone with clear boundaries in `app/static/index.html`
- Added proper styling with CSS classes for different states
- Included file input fallback for browsers that don't support drag-and-drop

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Event Handling
- Implemented `handleDragOver`, `handleDrop`, and `handleDragLeave` event handlers in `app/static/js/upload.js`
- Added proper event delegation and cleanup
- Prevented default browser behavior for file drops
- Added cross-browser compatibility

### 3. File Input Fallback
- Added traditional file input button as fallback
- Synced file input with drag-and-drop functionality
- Supported multiple file selection
- Ensured fallback works on all browsers

### 4. Visual Feedback
- Added highlight zone on drag over
- Implemented file name and size display
- Added loading states during upload
- Included error states for invalid files

### 5. Backend API Integration
- Fixed API router prefix issues
- Ensured files are uploaded to `/api/v1/convert` endpoint
- Added progress feedback during upload
- Implemented error handling for failed uploads
- Added success feedback with response handling

### 6. Testing and Validation
- Verified server is running and serving the frontend
- Tested API endpoints (`/api/v1/health` and `/api/v1/convert`)
- Confirmed JavaScript is being loaded and executed
- Verified event listeners are properly attached
- Tested file input fallback functionality

The drag-and-drop upload zone is now fully functional and ready for use. Users can drag files onto the drop zone or use the file input button as a fallback. The interface provides visual feedback and integrates seamlessly with the backend API for file conversion.
